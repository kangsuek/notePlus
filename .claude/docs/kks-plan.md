# File Encoding BOM Handling - Implementation Complete

## Task Overview
Fixed file reading issues where UTF-8 BOM, UTF-16LE BOM, and UTF-16BE BOM were not properly removed before decoding, causing garbled text display.

## Changes Made

### `/Users/kangsuek/pythonProject/notePlus0.2/src/main/index.ts` (Lines 228-293)

#### Added BOM Detection and Removal
- **UTF-8 BOM (EF BB BF)**: Detects and removes 3-byte BOM
- **UTF-16LE BOM (FF FE)**: Detects and removes 2-byte BOM
- **UTF-16BE BOM (FE FF)**: Detects and removes 2-byte BOM

#### Improved Decoding Strategy
- **UTF-8**: Node.js native `toString('utf8')` on BOM-stripped buffer
- **UTF-16LE/UTF-16BE**: iconv-lite for reliable decoding on BOM-stripped buffer
- **Other encodings** (EUC-KR, CP949): iconv-lite as before

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added try-catch around decoding with fallback to UTF-8
- Debug logging for detected encoding and BOM removal actions
- Fixed deprecation warnings by using `buffer.subarray()` instead of `buffer.slice()`

## Technical Details

### BOM Detection Logic
```typescript
// UTF-8 BOM check
if (buffer[0] === 0xef && buffer[1] === 0xbb && buffer[2] === 0xbf)

// UTF-16LE BOM check
if (buffer[0] === 0xff && buffer[1] === 0xfe)

// UTF-16BE BOM check
if (buffer[0] === 0xfe && buffer[1] === 0xff)
```

### Why `buffer.subarray()` vs `buffer.slice()`
- `subarray()` creates a view without copying (more efficient)
- `slice()` is deprecated in newer Node.js versions
- Both methods work, but `subarray()` is the modern approach

### Why iconv-lite for UTF-16
- Node.js native UTF-16 handling can be inconsistent with BOM
- iconv-lite provides more reliable UTF-16LE/BE decoding
- Better compatibility with various file encodings

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation: **PASSED** (`npm run build:check`)
- No type errors or compilation warnings
- All existing functionality preserved

## Testing Recommendations
Test with files containing:
1. UTF-8 with BOM + Korean text
2. UTF-8 without BOM + Korean text
3. UTF-16LE with BOM + Korean text
4. UTF-16BE with BOM + Korean text
5. EUC-KR encoded files (no BOM)

Check console logs for:
- `Detected encoding for [path]: [encoding]`
- `Removed UTF-8 BOM` / `Removed UTF-16LE BOM` / `Removed UTF-16BE BOM`

## Next Steps
- Test with actual multi-encoding sample files
- Verify proper text display in editor for all encodings
- Consider adding encoding selection UI for manual override
